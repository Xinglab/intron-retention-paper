# intron-retention-scripts

The scripts used in the manuscript entitled 'Tracking pre-mRNA maturation across subcellular compartments identifies developmental gene regulation through intron retention and nuclear anchoring' are included in the present folders for the purpose of reproducibility and transparency of the results from the manuscript.

The scripts are broken down by the order of analysis. 

The code is provided without a warranty. Codes from parts of the analysis are rewritten to make them easy to understand thus may cause errors when running them. If you encounter any problems or questions, please report them to the author (zcpan1016@gmail.com).
